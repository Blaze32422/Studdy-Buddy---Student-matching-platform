        We are aiming to create an <strong>online study buddy system</strong> for college students.
        Many times students struggle with one or more classes, and going to a professor does not
        always provide enough help.
      </p>
      <p>
        This platform lets students connect with peers who have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Already taken the class and are comfortable with the topics, or</li>
        <li>Are facing similar issues and want someone to work with.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Students send out <strong>study request posts</strong> stating the class(es) they need help with.
        Other students can see these requests and accept them if they wish to collaborate.
